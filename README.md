# Tracking Barbell Exercises
*Mini Master Project | Dave Ebbelaar | Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam*

This repository provides all the code to process, visualize, and classify accelerometer and gyroscope data obtained from [Mbientlab's WristBand Sensor Research Kit](https://mbientlab.com/). The data was collected during gym workouts where participants were performing various barbell exercises.

#### Exercises

#### Goals
* Classify barbell exercises
* Count repetitions
* Detect improper form 

#### Installation
Create and activate an anaconda environment and install all package versions using `conda install --name <EnvironmentName> --file conda_requirements.txt`. Install non-conda packages using pip: `pip install -r pip_requirements.txt`.
